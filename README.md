# Pig Game

## Overview

The **Pig Game** is a simple yet fun dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is for two players to collect 20 points first by rolling the dice and holding their score. Players take turns, and when a "1" is rolled on the dice, their current turn score is lost, and it switches to the other player. The game is won by the first player to reach 20 points.

The game has 3 main buttons for interaction:

- **Roll Dice**: Rolls the dice and adds the value to the player's turn score.
- **Hold**: Adds the current turn score to the player's total score and switches to the next player.
- **New Game**: Resets the game state and starts a new game.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Players alternate turns to accumulate points.
- **Dice rolling**: A random number between 1 and 6 is generated for each roll.
- **Turn-based mechanics**: If a player rolls a "1", they lose their accumulated points for that turn.
- **Game reset**: The "New Game" button resets the scores and starts a new game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game and interface.
- **CSS**: Styling of the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interaction.
